# Windows Server 2019 (Evaluation) template

Builds `x86_64/windows-server-2019` into the local template store from the Microsoft Evaluation
Center ISO (downloaded and sha256-verified automatically), fully unattended via
`unattend/autounattend.xml`.

```sh
./fetch-deps.sh          # one-time: virtio drivers + guest MSIs into unattend/
vmlab template build     # ~30-45 minutes
vmlab template list      # → x86_64/windows-server-2019@17763.737
```

What happens (`scripts/install.ws` narrates it in the build log):

1. The build VM boots the eval ISO; the script types through the
   "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD" prompt (and resets + retries if
   the firmware shell appears instead).
2. `autounattend.xml` (on the UNATTEND ISO built from `unattend/`) loads
   the virtio storage/net drivers in WinPE, partitions UEFI/GPT, installs
   **Standard Evaluation (Desktop Experience)**, sets `Administrator` / `vmlab123!`, and on first logon installs
   the virtio guest tools and the QEMU guest agent.
3. The script waits for the guest agent — that's the "install finished" signal.
4. The script stages `unattend/sysprep-unattend.xml` onto the disk and runs
   `sysprep /generalize /oobe /shutdown`, which powers the VM off; vmlab seals
   the generalized disk.

Notes:

- `fetch-deps.sh` stages redistributable binaries (virtio drivers, MSIs) into
  `unattend/`; they are gitignored, only the answer file is tracked. `just`
  runs it automatically before the build.
- The evaluation license runs 180 days from install. The `sha256` in
  `vmlab.wcl` is authoritative — the build refuses any ISO that doesn't match
  it. If the `url` ever 404s (eval-center CDN paths can change), grab the
  current direct link for this build from the eval center and keep the same
  `sha256` (or update both for a newer build via `sha256sum`).
- The sealed image is **generalized**: each clone's first boot replays
  `sysprep-unattend.xml` — fresh SID, auto-generated computer name, OOBE
  skipped, `Administrator` / `vmlab123!` restored with one autologon — so
  clones are domain-joinable out of the box. (the build-time computer name VMLAB-WS2019 is replaced per clone)
