# Generalize this Windows image with sysprep, retrying past AppX
# "installed for a user but not provisioned" blockers.
#
# Why this is not just `sysprep /generalize`:
#   * On modern Windows codebases, sysprep /generalize aborts with
#     0x80073cf2 if any AppX package is installed for a user but not provisioned
#     for all users. Consumer packages (WindowsFeedbackHub, WindowsTerminal, ...)
#     register for the Administrator profile ASYNCHRONOUSLY after first logon, so
#     a one-shot pre-strip races them and misses whichever hasn't finished yet.
#   * sysprep.exe detaches and returns an unreliable exit code (0 even when it
#     aborts), so success must be judged by the Sysprep_succeeded.tag it writes
#     only on a clean generalize.
#   * We must NOT blanket-deprovision: a provisioned-but-not-installed package is
#     fine, but deprovisioning a package we then fail to remove per-user (e.g.
#     DesktopAppInstaller / winget, which is un-removable, 0x80070032) CREATES the
#     very mismatch we're trying to avoid.
#
# So: run sysprep, and each time it aborts on an AppX blocker, remove exactly the
# package it named (per-user, all users — no deprovisioning) and retry. The
# blocker is named only once it is fully registered, so the loop converges.
