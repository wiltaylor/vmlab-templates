# vmlab-templates

A collection of [vmlab](https://github.com/wiltaylor/vmlab) template
definitions for common operating systems. Each directory is a standalone
template: `cd` into it and run `vmlab template build`.

## Templates

| Directory | OS | Source strategy |
|---|---|---|
| `ubuntu-24.04/` | Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS | Installer ISO + subiquity autoinstall |
| `debian-13/` | Debian 13 (trixie) | Cloud qcow2 + cloud-init |
| `fedora-44/` | Fedora 44 | Cloud Base qcow2 + cloud-init |
| `rocky-9/` | Rocky Linux 9 | GenericCloud qcow2 + cloud-init |
| `alpine-3.23/` | Alpine Linux 3.23 | NoCloud qcow2 + cloud-init |
| `nixos-25.11/` | NixOS 25.11 | Minimal ISO + scripted nixos-install |
| `kali/` | Kali Linux 2026.1 | Official QEMU qcow2 (run `fetch-deps.sh` first) |
| `parrot/` | Parrot OS Security 7.2 | Official QEMU qcow2 (run `fetch-deps.sh` first) |
| `windows-server-2025/` | Windows Server 2025 Eval | Installer ISO + autounattend, sysprep-generalized (run `fetch-deps.sh` first) |
| `windows-server-2022/` | Windows Server 2022 Eval | Installer ISO + autounattend, sysprep-generalized (run `fetch-deps.sh` first) |
| `windows-server-2019/` | Windows Server 2019 Eval | Installer ISO + autounattend, sysprep-generalized (run `fetch-deps.sh` first) |
| `windows-11/` | Windows 11 Enterprise Eval | Installer ISO + autounattend, sysprep-generalized (run `fetch-deps.sh` first) |
| `windows-10/` | Windows 10 Enterprise Eval | Installer ISO + autounattend, sysprep-generalized (run `fetch-deps.sh` first) |

All Windows eval ISOs are downloaded and sha256-verified by vmlab just like the
Linux ones; `fetch-deps.sh` only fetches the virtio guest drivers that get baked
into the answer-file media (and `just` runs it for you).

### arm64 (aarch64)

These build the same distros for `aarch64`, all from cloud images +
cloud-init. They boot UEFI (AAVMF) on the QEMU `virt` machine; on x86 hosts
they run under **TCG** (no KVM), so builds are slow.

| Directory | OS | Store ref |
|---|---|---|
| `alpine-3.23-arm64/` | Alpine Linux 3.23 | `aarch64/alpine-3.23` |
| `debian-13-arm64/` | Debian 13 (trixie) | `aarch64/debian-13` |
| `fedora-44-arm64/` | Fedora 44 | `aarch64/fedora-44` |
| `ubuntu-arm64/` | Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS | `aarch64/ubuntu-24.04` |

`windows-11-arm64/` also exists but is **experimental and not part of
`just build-arm64`**: Microsoft publishes no stable ARM64 eval ISO link/hash, so
you must fill in `url`/`sha256`/`version` in its `vmlab.wcl` first, then build it
on its own with `just windows-11-arm64-build`. See its README.

## Conventions

- Credentials baked into every template: user `vmlab`, password `vmlab`
  (Windows: `Administrator` / `vmlab123!` — see its README).
- The QEMU guest agent is installed and enabled, so lab clones come up
  with the "ready" flag and support `vmlab exec` / `vmlab cp`.
- Versions are pinned; ISO/qcow2 sources carry sha256 sums from the
  vendor's official checksum files. Downloads are cached and verified by
  vmlab under `~/.cache/vmlab/artefacts/`.
- Build VMs get NAT (`nic { nat = true }`) for package installs during
  provisioning.

## Usage

With [just](https://github.com/casey/just):

```sh
just                    # list recipes
just debian-build       # build one template (skips if already in the store)
just build              # build all x86_64 templates
just debian-arm64-build # build one arm64 template
just build-arm64        # build all arm64 templates (slow under TCG)
```

Or by hand:

```sh
cd debian-13
vmlab validate          # sanity-check the definition
vmlab template build    # download, install, seal into the local store
vmlab template list     # confirm it landed
```

Builds are idempotent: a template already in the store is skipped (per
`vmlab template exists`; run `vmlab template rm <ref>` to force a
rebuild), and templates with a `fetch-deps.sh` get their payloads staged
automatically. Requires vmlab with the `template exists` verb.

Reference a built template from a lab:

```wcl
vm "box" { template = "x86_64/debian-13" }
```
