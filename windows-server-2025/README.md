# Windows Server 2025 (Evaluation) template

Builds `x86_64/windows-server-2025` into the local template store from the
Microsoft Evaluation Center ISO (downloaded and sha256-verified
automatically), fully unattended via `unattend/autounattend.xml`.

```sh
./fetch-deps.sh          # one-time: virtio drivers + guest MSIs into unattend/
vmlab validate
vmlab template build     # ~30-45 minutes
vmlab template list      # → x86_64/windows-server-2025@26100.1742
```

What happens (`scripts/install.ws` narrates it in the build log):

1. The build VM boots the eval ISO; the script types through the
   "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD" prompt (and resets + retries if
   the firmware shell appears instead).
2. `autounattend.xml` (on the UNATTEND ISO built from `unattend/`) loads
   the virtio storage/net drivers in WinPE, partitions UEFI/GPT, installs
   **Standard Evaluation (Desktop Experience)**, sets `Administrator` /
   `vmlab123!`, and on first logon installs the virtio guest tools and the
   QEMU guest agent.
3. The script waits for the guest agent — that's the "install finished"
   signal.
4. The script stages `unattend/sysprep-unattend.xml` onto the disk and runs
   `sysprep /generalize /oobe /shutdown`, which powers the VM off; vmlab
   seals the generalized disk.

Notes:

- `fetch-deps.sh` stages redistributable binaries (virtio drivers, MSIs)
  into `unattend/`; they are gitignored, only the answer file is tracked.
- The evaluation license runs 180 days from install. To move to a newer
  eval build, update `version`, the `url`, and `sha256` in `vmlab.wcl`
  (sha256: download the ISO once and `sha256sum` it).
- The sealed image is **generalized**: each clone's first boot replays
  `sysprep-unattend.xml` — fresh SID, auto-generated computer name, OOBE
  skipped, `Administrator` / `vmlab123!` restored with one autologon — so
  clones are domain-joinable out of the box. First boot of a clone takes a
  few extra minutes while specialize runs.
