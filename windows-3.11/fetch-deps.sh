# (b) point its display driver at the generic VGA driver: the stock SYSTEM.INI
# is configured for an S3 Trio64V card, which QEMU does not emulate, so on the
# windows-9x profile's Cirrus VGA the S3 driver would fail to start. VGA.DRV +
# its grabber/fonts (VGA.3GR, VGA*.FON) are already present in WINDOWS/SYSTEM.
